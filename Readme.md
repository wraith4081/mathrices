# Introduction
Mathrices is a robust and versatile mathematical expression evaluator built in TypeScript. Leveraging Abstract Syntax Trees (AST), Mathrices can parse and evaluate a wide range of mathematical expressions, including complex numbers, units, matrices, conditionals, and symbolic differentiation. Whether you're building a calculator, a computational engine, or integrating mathematical capabilities into your application, Mathrices provides a powerful foundation.

## Features
- Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
- Variables and Constants: Define and use variables with support for built-in constants.
- Complex Numbers: Handle operations involving complex numbers.
- Units Support: Perform calculations with physical units, ensuring dimensional consistency.
- Matrices and Arrays: Execute matrix addition, multiplication, and indexing.
- Conditional Expressions: Evaluate expressions based on conditions.
- Lambda Functions: Define and use anonymous fugnctions with parameter support.
- Symbolic Differentiation: Perform symbolic differentiation of expressions with respect to variables.
- Function Definitions: Define and invoke custom functions.
- Error Handling: Comprehensive error messages for undefined variables, unsupported operations, and more.
